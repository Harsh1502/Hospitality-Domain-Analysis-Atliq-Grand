Points Understood after stakeholder meetings
Hospitality


Fluctuating ADR not there -- RevPar is fluctuating bcuz of Occupancy fluctuation
People do multiple bookings and keep the lowest rated as Last Option so Cancellation Rates Also increased
Pricing types - Flat, Dynamic, WeekDay/Ends 
Differential Pricing - Low PRice at own Channel cuz of no commision 
[But u cant do this as MakeMyTrip uses bot to scrape valeus and willl not list your hotel
SO use promotion at the checkout place]


Pareto Principle - 
80% problem by 20% of the hotel
OR 20% bring the highest Reveneu thaan the 80% hotels

RevPAR: Offers a more comprehensive picture of your hotel's financial health, as it considers both room pricing and occupancy.
It takes into account both your occupancy rate (percentage of rooms filled) and your average daily rate (ADR).
Formula: RevPAR = Total room revenue / Total available rooms

ADR: Helps understand your pricing strategy and its effectiveness in capturing market value.
average price you charge per occupied room.
It doesn't consider empty rooms, only those that were booked and generated revenue.
Formula: ADR = Total room revenue / Rooms sold
